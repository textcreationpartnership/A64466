            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BOth Scripture and experience hath made it manifeſt to the world, that a <hi>Religious Faſt,</hi> when duly attended, is a Duty of no ſmall importance and advantage to the people of God. But thoſe ſpiritual performances, which if right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly managed, are the moſt beneficial, have a ſpecial difficulty and contrariety to fleſh and blood accompanying them. So is it an hard work to keep a <hi>Faſt</hi> in ſuch a manner, as that it ſhall become an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Day unto the Lord: whence alſo it cometh to paſs, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few even amongſt thoſe that outwardly obſerve Faſting Dayes, are acquainted with the inward, ſpiritual, &amp; acceptable part of the duty. There have been that as to what is external in ſuch ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces regard not the divine precept; Some think the Prophet Iſaiah (in that Chapter (which is partly and judiciouſly opened in the enſuing Sermon) reproveth Enormities in that kind. And although mercy is better then Sacrifice, nor may we urge any ſeverities beyond what the word of God doth impoſe, yet it is to be feared that many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us do not make due conſcience of that outward abſtinence which the rule, and which the nature of the duty doth require. <note place="margin">

            <p>IT is (my beloved) hard work yea, one of the hardeſt parts of the work of the Miniſtry, to awaken a people that are rocked a ſleep in ſin; eſpecially a profeſſing people, that are lifted up to emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent degrees in profeſſion, exalted with great priviledges, and have their hearts raiſed with theſe things unto great pride, this (I ſay is a great and difficult work of the Miniſtry to awaken ſuch: But ſuch a People this Prophet had to do withal, and therefore you ſee what be muſt do, ver. 1. <hi>Cry aloud ſpare not,</hi> ſtretch thy throat, ſpare no pains, <hi>lift up thy voice like a Trumpet, and ſhew my peopl their tranſgreſſions, &amp; the houſe of</hi> Jacob <hi>their ſins.</hi> They had Watchmen amongſt them, but they did not watch; <hi>Dogs that did not bark,</hi> Iſai. 56. 10. and therefore the Prophet muſt <hi>cry aloud,</hi> and ſhew them their ſins. Why? were they ſo vile a people? they were eminent in profeſſion, exalted in priviledges, and arrogant in both, as appears in five or ſix things. 1. <hi>They ſeek me daily,</hi> ver 2. 2. <hi>They delight to know my wayes.</hi> 3. <hi>They did Righteouſneſs,</hi> and they forſook not the Ordinances of God, they were a practicing People, as well as a knowing people, and further, they enquire and ask after the Ordinances of Juſtice, and profeſs great delight in approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, and that not only in common and ordinary duties, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, ver. 3. <hi>We have faſted, and we have afflicted our Souls in our Faſt,</hi> and yet ſaith God to the Prophet: <hi>Cry aloud, ſpare not, lift up thy voice like a Trumpet, and make them to know their tranſgreſſions</hi> &amp;c. They were yet a people that did need awakening notwithſtanding all this.</p>
            <p>But when was this people in this frame? and when was there ſuch matter of complaint againſt them? I Anſwer in general, it was when they did keep hypocritical Faſts, which are here deſcribed, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. 4. &amp; they did Faſt, but yet they did not Faſt; It was a Faſt (as to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal obſervation,) when it was not a Faſt, as to the ſpiritual Efficacy and right performance of this holy Service. They were lifted up with their

            <p n="2">2.

            <p> Hence we may obſerve.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That a Faſt of Gods chuſing, or ſuch a Faſt as God hath choſen will certainly bring ſeaſonable pledges of Gods gracious acceptation.</hi> When the heart is right for God, and the Faſt is ordered according to God it ſhall certainly obtain mercy, and bring home help and ſuccour from God. Prayer, eſpecially, extraordinary prayer is not only the Key of all earthly Treaſures of Goodneſs, which God hath laid up for the Sons of men on Earth, but the Key of heavenly Treaſures in Chriſt Jeſus alſo.</p>
            <p>I ſhall obſerve this method in managing this Subject. 1. I ſhall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen unto you the nature of a Faſt, and ſuch a Faſt as God hath choſen.</p>
            <p>2. I ſhall ſhew you thoſe Teſtimonies which God will give of his gracious acceptation unto ſuch a Faſt. 3. I ſhall endeavour to ſhow you the ſeaſons wherein God is wont to give, and his people may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſuch manifeſt Teſtimonies of his gracious acceptation 4. I ſhall labour to help your Faith with ſome invincible Arguments and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of this Truth, and then the Reaſons of the point, and Laſtly, how much this concerns us, a people ſo Circumſtanced as we are.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the nature of a Faſt you may take this imperfect diffinition or deſcription of it not taken ſtrictly, only for an adjunct or means of worſhip, but more largely as I ſuppoſe in my Text, and ſo a Faſt is an extraordinary part or act of Goſpel worſhip wherein for a convenient Seaſon we abſtain from the comforts of this life, and upon due exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our wayes towards God, and conſideration of Gods wayes towards us, we make a ſolemn and real profeſſion that we juſtifie God and judge our ſelves, we juſtifie God for the evil of affliction that we either feel or fear and judge our ſelves for the evil of tranſgreſſion which we find within us or that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and ſorrows, we ſolemnly profeſs that we with all readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs forgive others that have offended us, as we hope to be forgiven of God, and laſtly we ſolemnly engage and bind our ſelves to reform the evil of our wayes, and to walk before God in new obedience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his word for the time to come. There is much of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion lyes in the right underſtanding of a Spiritual Faſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore I ſay firſt [a Faſt.]</p>
            <p>The very notion of a Faſt ſpeaks abſtinence, a Faſt is that wherein a man denyes himſelf the uſe of ordinary things whereto he is accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and neceſſitated for ſome certain ends and for a certain ſeaſon;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101730:6"/> if there be not a denying your ſelves ordinary comforts, there is no Faſt, and if not in order to worſhip, it is not a religious Faſt. And therefore though this be but an adjunct of worſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet its an adjunct appointed by God to abſtein from your ordinary comforts, and that in three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To abſtein from meat and drink wholly, if ſtrength of nature will bear it, if not, ſo much as mercy and neceſſity will permit;</hi> This at leaſt is com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manded of old, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 4. 16. neither eat nor drink three dayes, night nor day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhe appointed a three dayes Faſt, which thoſe Countries might better bear, and upon that extraordinary occaſion they might not eat nor drink, night nor day, ſo <hi>Nineveh</hi> they muſt not eat nor drink, they are forbidden not only wine, but water, <hi>Jonah.</hi> 3 7.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>It is a part of the abſtinence requiſite to this duty, to abſtein from our wonted Ornaments.</hi> To adorn the body in the day of Faſt is a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Rule of faſting, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 4, 5, 6. there they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to put off their Ornaments, and they were wonted alſo to cloath themſelves in Sackcloth, now the rigour of this according to the darkneſs of thoſe ſhadowing times is not exacted from us, yet there is a proportion to be obſerved.

And they were wont alſo to ſprinkle duſt and aſhes upon their heads, and to expreſs all manner of ſelf deſpiſings and ſelf abomination. If you be loth to put off your Ornaments, then its an humbling, and if it be an humbling, you ought to abſtein from them with other your ordinary comforts, in an extraordinary humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>An abſteining from all your lawful imployments and ſports, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations,</hi> yea, even the pleaſures of a Married life, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7 5. <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 16.

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:101730:6"/>2. Now this very outward abſtinence as an help to the worſhip in the day, and ſo the whole Faſt is a Goſpel duty, that is, it is a duty di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under the Covenant of grace, and not apperteining to the Covenant of works; for the Covenant of works did not admit of any day of Atonement: But it is the Goſpel that appoints dayes of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and it is required in the Goſpel, as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>when the Bridegroom is abſent the Children of the Bride-Chamber ſhall Faſt,</hi> the Bridegroom is Chriſt, and the Children are Believers under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and when he is abſent, that is in Heaven, before he returns again there ſhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e times of Faſting, <hi>Math.</hi> 9 15. <hi>Can the Children of the Bride-Chamber mourn as long as the Bridegroom is with them, but the dayes ſhall come that he ſhall be taken from them, and then they ſhall Faſt,</hi> and the Apoſtle gives direction how they ſhould manage themſelves in Faſting and Prayer, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7 5. and therefore its a Goſpel duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But yet (though a Goſpel duty) it is an extraordinary duty, Faſting is not an every weeks duty in a conſtant Courſe, as the Phariſe thought, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 12 ſaying, <hi>I Faſt twice a week.</hi> God hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſix dayes for labour and one for a Sabbath and therefore for men to appoint to themſelves conſtant Sabbaths, beſides the Sabbath of the Lord, is will-worſhip, and not acceptable to God. This then is not for Ordinary but ſpecial occaſions; as firſt when there is ſome notable or eminent publick Danger, as in the dayes of <hi>Jehoſhapha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 3. So when ſome notable duty is to be performed which is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and hazardous, then is a ſeaſon for a Faſt as it was with <hi>Eſther,</hi> Chap. 4. 14 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Again, when there is ſome great ſickneſs lying upon thoſe that are near and dear unto us, Pſal. 35. 13, 14. <hi>But as for me, when they were ſick my clothing was ſackcloth, I humbled my Soul with Faſting, and I behaved myſelf as though he had been my friend or brother, I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.</hi> A friend and brother or Mother, or near Relations, when they are ſick and weak and in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous condition, it calls for Faſting, there is then opportunity and occaſion for this duty.</p>
            <p>Again, when there is ſome notable bleſſing wanting, or we are in danger to looſe it: And ſo when a perſon or people are fallen under ſome great tranſgreſſion, whereby God may be provoked to indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt them, its a time of Faſting and mourning; thus <hi>Ezra.</hi> 9. 4, 5, 6 in the caſe of their marrying ſtrange wives, and polluting the holy ſeed. So when God goes forth againſt a people in ſome notable calamity, or threatning judgment; as when Iſrael fled before the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101730:7"/> Joſhua and the elders faſted, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. So in any notable change or turn of a mans life, as the undertaking of a Calling or ſome great Voyage, then is a time to begin with Faſting and prayer, to Implore the aid of Gods gracious preſence, his guidance, conduct &amp; ſalvation: Thus did Ezra, when he was going up from Babilon. <hi>Ezra</hi> 8. 21, 22 23. So that a Faſt is not a ſtanding duty, but occaſional, as it is now to be obſerved in the dayes of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>2. Concerning the ſpiritual performance of it, and here firſt in order to the preparation thereto, there is examination of our own wayes, and conſideration of the works of God; theſe are preparatory, and for want of theſe it is that mens hearts are utterly indiſpoſed to ſuch ſpiritual ſervices: <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 6. to 12. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3 38. to 44. in which you find them conſidering and bewailing both their own ſins, and Gods Judgments upon them for ſin.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be ſhown, is the very work of a Faſt in the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, and ſo I call it a real Profeſſion, to diſtinguiſh between an acceptable and an unacceptable Faſt; I ſay it is a ſolemn &amp; real profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. This people profeſſed great delight in Gods Ordinances, and ſought the Lord daily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that they did, and would cleave to God in his appointments: They enquire after his mind, they make great profeſſion, and ſo exact were they in their Faſts, that they afflicted their ſoul, and bowe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Q. What is the Faſt which God hath choſen?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is when the Heart is ſincerely and intirely carried forth in a holy Conformity to that which the duty makes profeſſion of? <hi>my Son give me thy heart</hi> ſayes God, God cares not for external performances without the heart, <hi>they are but as the cutting off a Dogs neck, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa 66 3. It is an high abomination when you come without a ſuitable heart to a day of Humiliation. There are four things which ſhow a ſuitable heart to a day of Humiliation,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> When the ſoul comes with brokenneſs &amp; contrition of heart, when a holy trembling ſeizes upon ſuch a man; when he draws nigh, leſt he provoke God, and procure his indignation, a broken heart and contrite ſpirit begins the day and goes along through the day, when the ſpirit is indeed ſuited to the duty.</p>
            <p>2. There is a penitent ſelf abaſement before God in and by the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Theſe Jews (that is the falſe hearted amongſt them, though there were ſome among them that were upright) they quarrel with God, <hi>wherefore have we faſted</hi> ſay they, <hi>and thou ſeeſt not:</hi> but the ſincere ſoul is humbled in the acknowledgment of this, That it were a juſt and righteous thing with God to caſt away his prayers and ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for God owes him nothing <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there is a ſtrong and firm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, that (the Grace of God aſſiſting) he will no more return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vanity.</p>

               </gap>ers not; nor delayes nor puts off the doing of that work which concerns it to promote the end of its Faſting: You draw nigh to God, that your hearts and wayes may be reformed; do you doe it forthwith.

If it be not time for you to doe your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is time for you to ſuffer affliction. If it be not time for you to carry on a thorow Reformation, it's time for God to carry on your ſorrows and afflictions toward your deſolation. Theſe delaying ſouls do not keep a Faſt unto God; when you reſolve a Faſt, you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to begin and proſecute this work of turning unto God that very day, and carry it on to the end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly.</hi> A Faſt which God hath choſen alwayes leaves a warm im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of love one towards another, and to all mankind as God gives opportunity. Oh when you have taſted mercy from God, how merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full will it make you to be to others. Therefore when men are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, cruel and harſh and their ſpirits not inclined to mercy, they have been very little with God to what they ought to be.</p>

            <p>Again, Why is this called the Faſt which God hath choſen?</p>
            <p>I anſwer briefly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe that ſuch a Faſt doth exactly anſwer the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of Gods will about it, which he had eternally in himſelf and which he gives forth to us in his holy Word, &amp; therefore it is referred to its firſt pattern and exemplar unto the will and choyce of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Its a Faſt that God hath choſen, becauſe God prefers this above any other kind of Faſt: There are Faſts many, but this God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers above all: There are Faſts which obtain ſome anſwer from God, yet are not like theſe. You know what Ahab obtained from God by faſting, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21 27, 28, 29. God had reſpect to his Faſting and humbling himſelf, and Ahab obtained a Reprieve thereby, ſo that the Judgment threatned was not executed in his dayes; but yet Ahab did not faſt with ſuch a Faſt as God hath choſen, and delights in, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Becauſe God takes pleaſure and hath a gracious reſpect to his people in it, and after it, the ſervice is acceptable to him when it is a day he hath choſen, and it aſcends as the offering of a ſweet ſmelling Sacrifice: this is noted in that the other is not an accepted day to the Lord, but this is a day wherein God takes pleaſure in Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if there be joy in Heaven when one ſinner is converted, how much more when a whole Congregation is thus doing, to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite Spirit, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66. 2. how much more when it is thus with a people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. He will take his own time to manifeſt his own gracious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of his people in ſuch a Faſt. You are not preſently anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (you'l ſay) as you expected. Be it ſo, Remember your time is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, but Chriſts hour is not yet come, <hi>but he that ſhall co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, will come and will not tarry,</hi> beyond his own time to Anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> II. We are come in the ſecond place to conſider what thoſe ſpiritual or outward benefits are, whereby the Lord is wont to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his gracious acceptation of ſuch a Faſt; And in general you may take it as a certain Truth that when God is pleaſed to Anſwer the prayers of his people, he teſtifies his acceptation thereof, but more particularly, there are three things whereby God diſcovers his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſuch a day as this is.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When he gives them a praying and faſting frame of Spirit, ſuch a frame as he requires for this is not in mans power, but it is the gift of Gods grace when <hi>God prepares the heart of the humble, he alſo hears their Cry,</hi> Pſal. 10. 17. when God cauſes your hearts and your Tongues to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101730:9"/> pray, he will certainly cauſe his ear to hear; for he is the Hearer of Prayer. Prayer is a gift of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. <hi>We know not how to pray, but the ſpirit helps our infirmities,</hi> and God knowes the meaning of the ſpirit in us. When a man prayes by his own ſpirit, his own ſpirit is under his own command, and therefore he is uniform in his Prayer he is not ſometimes ſtraightned, and ſometimes enlarged, except it be through the diſtempers of his Body, or the like: but when a man prayes by Gods Spirit, there are ſome ſtrange out-goings of the heart in prayer, which no mortal is able to command, ſuch enlargedneſs of heart, ſuch deſires after Chriſt and his grace, ſuch affliction for ſin, &amp; earneſt longing for deliverance, as no man can poſſibly command in his own heart, and when God gives ſuch a Spirit, it's an argument of his gracious acceptation. It's a day of Humiliation, when God gives you an humble ſpirit; it's a day of Abſtinence, when God puts into thy heart an earneſt deſire of divorcement from all ſin how pleaſant and profitable ſoever: this is a pledge of Gods gracious acceptation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that promiſe, Iſai. 65. 24. <hi>before they call, I will anſwer, and while they are yet ſpeaking, I will hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When God gives an heart, after faſting and Prayer to put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution that which concerns our ſelves in order to the obtaining our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritual requeſts &amp; ſupplications preſented unto God: that is when there is a reforming ſpirit, a purifying ſpirit, a watchful ſpirit againſt ſin, when the ſoul ſets himſelf with more watchfulneſs &amp; induſtry to the work of the Lord; and ſo a people, as in <hi>Nehe.</hi> 10. the whole Chapter, and the laſt Chap. of <hi>Ezra,</hi> after their humiliation, how active were they for a thorow Reformation, when Church and Court and all in their places endeavour the removal of ſin, and making up the breach between God and them, it is a certain demonſtration that God is near at hand to Anſwer them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is a marvellous gracious Argument of our acceptation with God when he gives in any of thoſe ſpiritual or outward bleſſings which are here mentioned in the Text, there are eight glorious priviledges here engaged to ſuch a perſon or people, 1. Light after darkneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 8. and 10. <hi>then ſhall thy Light break forth as the morning, and thy Light ſhall ariſe in obſcurity, and thy darkneſs ſhall be as the noon day,</hi> &amp;c. when God gives a poor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> morning, this is a great benefit. Light ſignifies not only the inlightning of the underſtanding, or quickning you with ſpiritual Light, but all kind of help and conſolation, and proſperity, and ſo darkneſs ſignifies all kind of affliction, whether it be ſenſe of ſin,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101730:10"/> or other ſorrows, or the like. There are four things in this.</p>
            <p>Firſt it is Light in darkneſs, when you ſee darkneſs hath covered your Souls that you have not known what your ſtate &amp; condition hath been, and thereupon hath been great affliction and Agony of Soul, and there hath been alſo great afflictions outwardly, as commonly one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction goes not alone, or when there hath been diſtreſs upon a people, and now God cauſes Light to ſpring after darkneſs, ſome glimpſes of hope, ſome raiſings up of your Spirits, and expectation of good dayes, ſome comfortable changes of providence, as <hi>Paul</hi> was comforted by the coming of <hi>Titus</hi> which he aſcribed to Gods comforting of him, this is Light after darkneſs.</p>
            <p>2. When this Light that is promiſed is gradual like the Light of the morning that <hi>ſhines more and more unto the perfect day</hi> you muſt not ſay there is no Light becauſe it is not noon at firſt, if it be but the dawning of the day, or the Light of the morning ſtar, you have cauſe to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it as an Anſwer of Prayers, if it do but foreſhow the beginning of your return from ſpiritual Captivity, or outward calamity, you are to acknowledge it as a ſpring<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng Light which ſhall go on to the perfect day in full perfection of glory.</p>
            <p>3. It is a prevailing and overcoming Light, it may be weak at firſt, and obſcured through clouds of darkneſs and temptation, but it ſhall be victorious and overco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing at the laſt.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, this Light is from the <hi>riſing of the Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> God will manifeſt his gracious acceptation to your Souls when <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhall ariſe with healing in his wings,</hi> Mal. 4. 2 that is, be it Light in Ordinances, or Light in providences it is ſtill a Light from the face of Jeſus Chriſt, there is ſomething of Chriſt in it, there are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon refreſhings that ſhine upon men which do not exalt Chriſt in the Soul but that ſaving Light that comes from Chriſt leads unto Chriſt, and makes Chriſt moſt precious and moſt glorious unto the Soul, now this is the Light God promiſes, whereby he will teſtifie his gracious acceptation of thoſe that keep the <hi>Faſt which he hath choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Thy health ſhall ſpring forth ſpeedily, that is, when God is pleaſed to make Faſtings healings, now this is his promiſe here, heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your Souls, of your Families, of your Churches of your common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, healing to your affairs inward and ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

They ſhall build the old waſts, this wilderneſs for ought I know hath lain waſte from the beginning, and there were never a Civilized people here before, now faſting and prayer is the way to build the old waſts of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi> 2. <hi>Thou ſhalt raiſe up the Foundations of many gnnerations,</hi> that is, thou, &amp; thy ſeed. 3. <hi>Thou ſhalt be called the repairer of the breach, the reſtorer of paths to dwell in</hi> many breaches are made in Churches and in common wealth and upon mens Souls, many breaches upon the viſible Church of God in the world, who are they that ſhall repair ſuch breaches? thoſe that obſerve ſuch a Faſt, as God hath choſen and the reſtorer of paths to dwell in in the times of confuſion, &amp; thoſe hurries that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men about the matters of Religion people looſe their paths, and know not how to order their wayes before him to gracious accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; you that Faſt with <hi>the Faſt which God hath choſen,</hi> God will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his gracious acceptation of you by making you and your poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Inſtruments to hold forth the wayes of God clearly, wherein poor Souls may walk with God, and find peace unto their Souls.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Again in the laſt verſe then ſhalt thou delight thy ſelf in the Lord. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are three things in it, &amp; the ſum of all is that ſuch a Faſt as God hath choſen ſhall be powerful and effectual to bring you to the higheſt happineſs; for firſt, you ſhall delight your ſelves in the Lord, you ſhall have God for your chiefeſt good, and he will be your portion to all Eternity. 2. You ſhall ride upon the high places of the Earth, you that are trodden down, ſhall have a time of Exaltation in a Kingdome that cannot be ſhaken, and thou ſhalt be fed with the heritage of <hi>Jacob</hi> thy Father, for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it, that is, after all your ſorrows and troubles, you ſhall find ſtill that God is your feeder, and that not with common food, but Jacobs heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which was threefold, 1. The bleſſings neceſſary for this life.</p>
            <p>2. The bleſſings neceſſary for his precious Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the feeding Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God, and 3. The Eternal feeding which is promiſed at the glorious appearance of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 17. <hi>the Lamb ſhall feed them and ſhall lead them unto living Fountains of water, and God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes,</hi> are not theſe glorious privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and admirable advantages? theſe are the ſpecial favours of God, whereby in due time he will manifeſt his gracious acceptation of his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101730:12"/> people, in their faſtings and prayers which have been ſuch as himſelf hath choſen. And thus we have ſeen the ſecond general point pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
            <p>3. The next thing is to ſhow the ſeaſon when God delights to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to give in the manifeſtation of his gracious acceptation of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: It is true, the Seaſons God hath reſerved in his own power, and therefore we cannot tell you the day, Moneth, or year, but yet there are certain ſigns that are wont to be Forerunners of Gods gracious manifeſtations. Therefore,</p>
            <p>I ſhall give you ſome general Characters for help of your faith and raiſing up your expectations as firſt, when the evil of affliction hath done its work, it may be God holds you long under ſome ſpiritual tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, or outward preſſure, you are as a Sheaf in threſhing upon the Floor, you have ſtroke after ſtroke hardly ever free from Tribulation, yet be content, when affliction hath done its work God will call it back, this was the Centurions Faith, <hi>Math.</hi> 8. 9 afflictions came not forth without <hi>a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> from God,</hi> and as <hi>it hath its Go</hi> from God, ſo it hath its Commiſſion, it hath <hi>a wiſe work to do, its Do this</hi> alſo, now when it hath done its work it ſhall have <hi>its Come,</hi> it ſhall be called off again. As he afflicts you for your profit ſo when the end is attained, the affliction ſhall be removed, it is to make you partaker of his holineſs; ſee then how the work of God proſpers in your Souls, under tryals, afflictions and Temptations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. When your hearts are quickned to urgent importunity for the bleſſing on the affliction, you may cry mightily for deliverance from evills felt or feared, theſe and thoſe diſtreſſes that are upon you; but are your ſouls wreſtling with God importunately for the bleſſing, as Jacob, <hi>I will not let thee goe except thou bleſs me.</hi> Its not the removing of the rod, but the giving in of the bleſſing that may refreſh thee, is it the bleſſing that thy ſoul is crying for, certainly God will anſwer ſuch prayers, as Jacob, after his earneſt wreſtling with God, ſees the face of God in the face of his brother Eſau.</p>
            <p>3. When your ſouls are ready to fail for thirſt. In all the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and trials of Gods people, God ſtill hath a tender care to prevent this ſad inconvenience, Iſa. 57. 16. <hi>I will not contend for ever, neither will I be alwayes wroth, for the ſpirit ſhould fail before me, and the ſouls which I have made:</hi> Hence David uſeth this as an argument, <hi>Hear me ſpeedily, my ſpirit doth fail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. When the enemy is moſt inſolent and violent. If the ſtorm be high and terrible, ordinarily it is not durable, the guſt will ſoon
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101730:12"/> blow over. When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord ſhall lift up a Standard againſt him. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 19. God himſelf will interpoſe and ingage for your ſouls, his ſpirit againſt your ſpiritual adverſaryes, and the wonders of his providence againſt your outward enemies. <hi>When he ſaw that there was none to help, then his own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> brought ſalvation;</hi> when they ſeem to be under the power of the enemy then it's time for God to work for their deliverance. God will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear (I ſay)</p>
            <p>5. When you are come to a deſperate Stand, you muſt have help or periſh; you have already ſuffered Ship-wrack and are in the midſt of the Flood, in the midſt of the fiery furnace, in the lions den, having received the ſentence of death in your ſelves, now is the time to truſt in the living God who quickneth the dead. <hi>In the mount of the Lord is ſhall be ſeen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly.</hi> That which is moſt comfortable, when your ſoul is brought to a quiet and patient ſubmiſſion to the hand and diſpenſation of God, committing your ſelves to his ſoveraign pleaſure and waiting pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently for his ſalvation, certainly your deliverance is near. This is a great myſtery whilſt a ſoul is ſtrugling againſt providence, and is diſpleaſed with Gods diſpen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation towards it, there is cauſe to fear that deliverance is far off; but when it comes to ſubmit delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is near, and pledges of Gods favour are at hand. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 26. <hi>If I ſhall find favour in the ſight of the Lord,</hi> ſaith David, <hi>he will bring me back again, but if he ſay, I have no delight in thee, behold here am I, let him doe to me what ſeemeth good unto him.</hi> Now David is not far from deliverance, when he is content that God ſhould fulfill his own pleaſure upon him whatſoever it be; and that this is the method that God is wont to obſerve in the way of his providence towards his people, the Apoſtle tells you, Rom. 5. 3, 4. <hi>Tribulation worketh Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Patience, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> hope, which maketh not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed.</hi> It's a miſtake in the myſtery of providence, to look for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of mercy in deliverance, before the work of patience in ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſignation to the will of God. Thus of the <hi>3d.</hi> thing.</p>
            <p>4. The next general Head is to demonſtrate to your Faith, that ſuch a Faſt as is of Gods chuſing ſhall have ſuch an iſſue: This is hard to believe in times of temptation, therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to bottome our Faith well, upon ſuch a foundation that cannot fail. I ſhall mention theſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That If God ſhould fail to manifeſt his acceptance of his people upon this account, then theſe and thoſe that are under the powerfull
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101730:13"/> command of ſeeking his face, ſhould ſeek his face in vain; but ſaith God <hi>I have not ſaid to the ſeed of Jacob, ſeek ye my face in vain,</hi> Iſa. 45. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The gracious promiſes that are before us are a ſufficient ſecurity that a Faſt that God hath choſen, ſhall bring ſuch gracious acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as thoſe eight promiſes mentioned, and alſo Pſal. 50. 15. <hi>Call upon me on the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me.</hi> And ſo, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8. 38. with many other verſes before and after: and Chriſt himſelf alſo promiſeth, that whatſoever ye ſhall ask in his name he will do it for you <hi>&amp;c. John.</hi> 14 14.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The manner of Gods dealing with his ſervants eſtabliſheth this truth unto us, Pſal. 119. 132. 133. <hi>&amp;c. Be mercifull unto me, as thou uſoſt to doe to thoſe that love thy name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That God doth not ſuffer the Faſtings and the Prayers of others when they are hearty though not ſpiritual, to goe without their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The young Ravens ſhall not cry unto him, but he will take care of them; he reſpects a very Ahab that ſold himſelf to work wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in the ſight of the Lord, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 21. 25. and yet <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>Becauſe he humbleth himſelf before me, I will not bring the evil in his dayes.</hi> And ſo when Nineveh humbled themſelves, he ſaved them from deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on though it was againſt the very grain of the ſoul of Jonah. <hi>Jon.</hi> 3. 10</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly.</hi> It muſt needs be ſo, becauſe there is nothing ſtands in the way to hinder it. A Faſt that God hath choſen removes all impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that ſtand in the way of mercy, the great obſtruction is ſome ſin committed, or ſome habitual impenitency remaining; for when the heart is truly humbled and broken, the ſoul is prepared for ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of mercy, wherein the acceptation of the Suppliant may be made manifeſt. Thus of the fourth general Head.</p>
            <p>V. The next thing is the Reaſon why God will do thus for his people, upon their faſting the Faſt which God hath choſen?</p>
            <p>I anſwer 1. Negatively, not for any inherent excellency in their faſtings and prayers, or ſervices, for what benefit hath God by our humbling our ſelves, laying aſide our Ornaments, &amp; ſo humbling our bodies, or by our diligent attention to external actions, but poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively I ſhall give you three reaſons of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe it is a Faſt that he hath choſen, and therefore it is ſo ſucceſfull: were it of mans chuſing it might be diſappointed, and yet God not diſhonoured; but he chuſeth it and appoints it, and now Gods honour lyes at ſtake for a gracious anſwer. It was the glory of God in Iſrael, to be manifeſtly near to that people in all they called upon him for. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:101730:13"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe the perſons are accepted (if ſuch perſons) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their offerings are accepted alſo. The Petition of a favourite is not eaſily rejected by the Prince, eſpecially being ſuch a Petition as his Prince hath choſen and appointed for him. They are in a ſtate of favour with God, and therefore their Petitions muſt needs be ſucceſsful. The ſpiritual Sacrifices of this royal holy Prieſthood are acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Becauſe there is an admirable, miſterious Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God the Father, Son and holy Ghoſt, and the right Suppliant or the perſon that faſts in the faſt which God hath choſen, for 1. there is not an holy prayer put up unto God, but its Original is God the Father, that prayer of Faith which proceeds from the heart of a Chriſtian, was 1. In the heart of God the Father, and he through the Interceſſion and Mediation of his Son, ſends it down by his holy Spirit into the heart of a poor ſinner, and ſo ſtamps the Image of it upon the heart of the poor ſinner that he believes, and then the Holy Ghoſt that ſtamped it there, takes it from thence, and preſents this through Chriſt unto the Father, &amp; then the Fathers heart is to give forth the anſwer through the Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Son, and to give notice of it to the Soul of a Chriſtian by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit. And when thou haſt received the anſwer, the ſame Spirit works in thy heart to return praiſe and Thanksgiving by the Son unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that here is a marvellous ſpiritual &amp; myſterious Communion in this, between God the Father, Son and holy Ghoſt, &amp; the poor believer, &amp; therefore ſuch faſting cannot be in vain. Thus of the fifth general head.</p>
            <p>6. Of what concernment this may be unto our ſelves, and truly it is of very great concernment. We are the people that do ſucceed Iſrael. We are <hi>Jacob.</hi> Gods people that are under the ſame profeſſion as the Lord ſpeaks of them here, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>that ſeek God dayly, and delight to know his wayes,</hi> this is our profeſſion, we are a Nation that ſeek Juſtice, that is our plea, that we muſt do right and not forſake the Ordinances of our God, this I ſay is our profeſſion that we are bound to hearken after Gods will, and enquire after the Ordinances of Juſtice, we are they that by our dayly practice in appearing before God in ſolemn Aſſemblies profeſs that we delight to approach to him, therefore we are they that have need to take notice of this great and ſolemn Truth, that the Faſt that is not of Gods chuſing will be ineffectual, but that which is of Gods chuſing will prevail, and that to five or ſix ends.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To build us up in knowledge, there are great miſteries contained in this Truth. I ſhall touch thoſe that are of preſent conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It teacheth you that there is a vaſt difference between duty and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, between religious performances and religious performances, that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101730:14"/> which is ſpoken of faſting reaches through the whole body of Religion, there is a prayer that God hath choſen, and a prayer that God hath not choſen, and ſo this or that Ordinance or obſervation there is that which God will own and accept &amp; there is that which he will not countenance nor bleſs: our God is a God that will be worſhipped in Spirit and in Truth, the manner and the end of our worſhip diſcovers what the nature of that ſervice is, or of that particular religious act which we put forth towards him, look then to your own Spirits in your worſhip of God, as it is ſaid of the perſon worſhipping, ſo it is true of the worſhip, <hi>he is not a Jew that is one outwardly, but he that is one inwardly,</hi> (Rom. 2. laſt verſe.) <hi>whoſe praiſe is not of men but of God;</hi> you may be outwardly a Chriſtian, and inwardly an heathen in the ſight of God, all theſe are uncircumciſed in heart ſayes the Prophet, when he reckons up the Nations together with <hi>Judah,</hi> you may be a Heathen in heart, whileſt you are in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man a Chriſtian, your Circumciſion may become uncircumciſion before God; alas what's an outward Baptiſme, if your Souls never reach after ſpiritual Baptiſme, if there be the waſhing with water without the Laver of Regeneration, and the renewing of the holy Ghoſt, can you reſt in that? or will God take pleaſure in it? What is it for you to eat the Lords Supper, and not to eat the Lord who is that Supper? that is to receive Chriſt therein by Faith, mind the Spirit with which, and the end for which you wait upon God in holy Ordinances, What is your prayer, if it be not the prayer which God hath choſen? it's but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion or voyce of a luſt that will not be accepted of God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>you ask and have not, becauſe you ask amiſs that you may conſume it upon your luſts,</hi> there are many mock ſervices whereby mock-Chriſtians mock God in their profeſſion. This is a ſad miſtery, but neceſſary to be known, there is a form of godlineſs without power, this is to make an Image to your ſelves, and to feed upon husks, and to deceive your own Souls with ſhadows, which will profit nothing; If you think to put off God with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide ſervices, ſuch have a <hi>form of godlineſs but deny the power thereof,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 5. <hi>from ſuch turn away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It concerns us to know how hard it is to awaken a ſecure ſinner that is covered under a form of godlineſs: take a profane perſon and the whole power of common Light, and common principles of humanity will fall in with the conviction of his miſerable loſt condition: tell a Drunkard that he ſhall drink in Hell for this his conſcience tells him ſo, when he is ſober. So an Adulterer his Conſcience being awakened tells him he ſhall ſuffer Eternal Torment for his moments pleaſure. So a gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging perſon his Conſcience falls in with the Conviction, but a man under
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101730:14"/> a form of godlineſs without the power thereof hath a ready ſalve for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſore, he ſtops his Ears with his Tongue, and becomes as the deaf Adder, hence ſaith God unto this people, <hi>Is this the Faſt that I have choſen?</hi> and inculcates it again and again, <hi>It is not the Faſt that I have choſen,</hi> &amp;c. and calls upon the Prophet, ver. 1. <hi>Cry aloud,</hi> cry out in thy throat, <hi>ſpare not, lift up thy voyce like a Trumpet,</hi> that thou mayſt awaken them to the conſideration of their ſin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It concerns us to know that all our ſpiritual duties &amp; ſervices muſt come to the trial, God will not only call us to account for all our open wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; groſs acts of Tranſgreſſion but will try every ſervice we perform; <hi>Is this the Faſt that I have choſen,</hi> ſayes God? was it ſuch a prayer, ſuch a participation in this or that Ordinance? Is this your Conference, are theſe the holy meetings, are theſe the Sabbaths? thus God will ask you, and God will accept none of your Services but they muſt paſs through Gods tryal; Therefore we have need to examine our own Services, and our hearts in them, you are in your Cloſets meditating, but is this the meditation God hath choſen for Spirit, for matter &amp; for manner? you are crying and praying, but is this the prayer that God hath choſen? you are reproving, counſelling admoniſhing your Children or others, but is it in the way that God hath choſen? you are dealing with your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or brother for ſome Tranſgreſſion, but is it ſuch an admonition as God hath choſen? remember that all your actions muſt come under this queſtion, whether or no they are ſuch as God hath choſen? <hi>I chuſe out their way for them,</hi> ſayes <hi>Job,</hi> of the time when he was as King among them, ſo if Chriſt be your King, he ſhall chuſe your way for you, and you will chuſe the things that pleaſe the Lord, and will not take any content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that which doth not anſwer the Lords expectation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As it is of great concernment for our knowledge, ſo it concerns us for our examination &amp; trial, to try our wayes before the Lord our God, if God will try our faſtings, prayers, &amp; other ſervices, we had need to try &amp; exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our ſelves. To judge our ſelves is the way to prevent Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Briefly examine we our ſelves concerning this our preſent Faſt, is it <hi>a Faſt which God hath choſen,</hi> as to our preparation for it? have you had ſolemn and ſerious thoughts concerning the way of Gods providence, concerning your perſons, your Families, your Relations <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have you conſidered your own Tranſgreſſions before God, &amp; the great cauſe you have had of deep humiliation before God in reſpect of them? The defect of this is a failing of Gods expectation in the beginning, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you may obtain in the procedure; have you been careful to abſtain from natural, neceſſary comforts &amp; refreſhings, further then neceſſity in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101730:15"/> reſpect of infirmity calls for, and hath your abſtinence proceeded from inward ſelf-abhorrency, becauſe of your ſins. Extream grief takes away the appetite to eating and drinking. All the ſelf denying acts that are required in a Faſt are to proceed from a deep affliction of heart, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is but a ſhallow performance, &amp; of no worth with God; It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the afflicting of the ſoul, and if it doe not come from Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affliction, it will be very unprofitable &amp; unacceptable. Again, are we real, are our hearts through with God in that ſolemn profeſſion we make in ſuch a day as this? Are you indeed ſenſible of your ſins whereby you have provoked the Lord: Our particular ſins, the ſins of our Familyes, towns Churches and the ſins of the Country? Doe we ſincerely look out to God in Jeſus Chriſt for the Spirit of Repentance? Is it his grace indeed that we look unto for help and ſuccour, and that in the very mediation of Chriſt Jeſus, through his death and blood-ſhed? Where is that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſelf-abhorrency that ſhould act and carry an end theſe holy ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Is there indeed a forgiving ſpirit? When you come before God are not your hearts, many of you, full of wrath &amp; anger, are you meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened like lambs before the Lamb of God in your holy offerings? Doe you preſent your ſelves upon that Altar which is the Lamb? Or do you faſt for ſtrife and debate, longing to be at it again, that you may mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt your diſpleaſure when the time is over? And is there in you a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of compaſſion and working of bowels toward the poor and needy, whilſt you are ſeeking mercy from God? Do you oblige and ingage your hearts to return to God, and to reform what is amiſs in your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Families, Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the object of your work, &amp; where you may have influence to the utmoſt of your power? The Lord help us ſolemnly to examine our ſelves, for if it be not thus with us, it's not the <hi>Faſt which God hath choſen:</hi> and mind what your ſin is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It's like the worſhipping of an Idol, you have turned an holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance into loathſome Idolatry, &amp; (as I may ſpeak with holy reverence) you have carried it towards God, as if he had been one of the Idols of the Gentiles.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You have taken the Name of God in vain this day in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner and ſo put an extraordinary diſhonour upon God, which is a moſt horrible profanation of the day, which ſhould be kept as a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; to keep it only with outward obſervance, without an heart ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſpoſed, and graciouſly inclined, will you call this an acceptable day to the Lord?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly.</hi> Conſider what will be the wofull iſſue, and evill conſequence of it upon your ſelves, except God give you repentance of your forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101730:15"/> in your ſervices: inſtead of ſoftening it will harden you, Inſtead of mortifying ſin, it will quicken it; inſtead of obtaining grace, it will bring diſpleaſure; it will drive the Spirit of God from you, and bring Satan near unto you, and inſtead of the good you deſire, it will bring about the contrary evill; you will be the worſe for it, &amp; not the better: where was there greater wickedneſs effected, then hath been done by Faſting &amp; Prayer? See the horrible wickedneſs in the matter of Naboth, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 21 was ever woman more hardned then <hi>Jezebel?</hi> &amp; who like <hi>Ahab</hi> that ſold himſelf to work wickedneſs in the ſight of the Lord, whom <hi>Jezebel</hi> ſtirred up. 'Tis the way to be ſealed up under the Tomb-ſtone of an hard heart to celebrate a Faſt with another Spirit, manner, and end then God hath choſen: Woeful ill conſequents come upon perſons and Families upon this account, commonly after a Faſt, or ſolemn Ordinance, if not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed according to God; men, women, and children are the worſe in their practice: <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 13. and this have you done again covering the Altar with tears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Inſomuch that he regards not the offering any more, or receiveth it with good will at your hand; when men will faſt and pray and cover Gods Altar with tears, and yet hold faſt their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, corrupt, and impenitent frame of heart, they will be worſe and worſe in their places and Relations as there he ſpeaks of the wife of youth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom they had dealt treacherouſly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And alas what outward miſeries will it bring upon a Family, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 29, 30. becauſe in eating the Supper of the Lord, they did not eat it, therefore one was ſick, another weak, and another fallen aſleep ſo if in faſting you do not faſt, if in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling your Souls, you do not humble your Souls, if in praying, you pray not, if you perform not ſuch Services as God hath choſen, it will bring ſickneſs upon thoſe that are well and weakneſs and death upon the ſick. It's mercy when we are thus judged of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. latter end.</p>
            <p>Again it concerns us to conſider what evil Conſequents will come upon a people in this caſe, whence comes wars whence comes Famine? whence plagues? theſe, and thoſe Judgements upon a profeſſing people? becauſe their worſhip is not worſhip, their godlineſs, their faſting and prayer is not ſuch as God hath choſen, there is not the life and power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in what they offer up to God and this provokes God to deal dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with them, when lighter afflictions will not prevail. This brought deſolation to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe <hi>they faſted to themſelves, and not to the Lord,</hi> Zach. 7. 13, 14. Therefore it is come to paſs that as <hi>he cried and they would not hear, ſo they cried and I would not hear, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, but I ſcattered them with a Whirlewind,</hi> &amp;c. For they laid the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Land deſolate.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:101730:16"/>
            <p>Again, it concerns thoſe of us that are true obſervers of ſuch a Faſt as God hath choſen, it concerns them for their conſolation as here in the dayes of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> when God was pleaſed to ſet ſo many preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hopes before them for themſelves and their poſterity, what a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort was it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is like to be your portion if God hath inclined your hearts to ſeek his Name.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, theſe promiſes are indeed very glorious, but how can I take comfort in them? ſince I find my ſelf falling ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhort in the qualifications required thereto?</p>

               </gap>alling ſhort in degree, and in the whole, if there be in you no degree of theſe ſpiritual qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons you muſt even wait upon God, in preſſing upon your hearts the dreadful conſequents thereof, but if there be any, though the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, I would not diſcourage you, for when we ſpeak of Evangelical du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we muſt underſtand the qualifications in a Goſpel ſenſe, God looks at ſincerity, and accepts the uprightneſs of the heart though accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much infirmity.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Object.</hi> Another may ſay, I have laboured many a year, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find my prayers thus anſwered.—<hi>Anſw.</hi> We ought not to judge our ſelves by the Iſſues of Divine providence, but by the operations of Gods Spirit in us, if the work have been gracious in thy heart, the Iſſue ſhall be glorious to thy Soul in the end, <hi>and he that ſhall come, will come, and will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>arry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Object.</hi> But if theſe things be neceſſary to an acceptable Faſt, what benefit is there in a publick Faſt, wherein the moſt do fall ſhort of what is required thereto?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whoſoever falls ſhort, thou that doſt keep this Faſt that God hath choſen, ſhalt have the bleſſing thereof. Therefore look to thine own heart, and thou ſhalt receive the Teſtimony of his gracious accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, God knows how to ſave the good Figs, when he deſtroys a whole Nation of bad, he can find an Ark for a <hi>Noah,</hi> and cull out eight perſons from a whole world to ſhew them his Salvation. Beſides publick Faſts procure at leaſt Reprieves. God will wait to ſee the fruit of it, and not put a full end to his patience, till there is no hope of anſwering Humiliation by Reformation.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, it concerns every one of us, to look diligently to our own Souls, when we have any ſuch ſervice to perform to the Lord our God that it be ſo done by us as God hath appointed, and that we repent of what hath not been according to Gods mind, and that we take care, that what remains may make it a Faſt after Gods own choice.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:101730:16"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Q w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y is that poſſible?</hi> Yes if now at laſt thy Soul truly repents of thy ſin, and be humbled and melts before God for thy carnality, thy unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredneſs for the day, and thy unſpiritualneſs in the day. And looking unto Chriſts Mediation for pardon, and acceptation, truſting in his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious help, you take up reſolutions to return to God, and to exerciſe mercy and loving kindneſs amongſt men and to do Juſtice and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to walk righteouſly, holily, and humbly with thy God it may turn this very Faſt into a time of joy, and in Gods gracious acceptation, may be eſteemed ſuch a Faſt as God hath choſen.</p>
            <p>I would propound a few things here to your conſideration as the Iſſue of this your Faſt, and but propound them briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Look into your own hearts, get alone and conſider what it is that hath been amiſs in hearts and lives for time paſt, and ſet a narrow watch over your Souls for time to come, that you may not provoke God, and becauſe you are weak and infirm, intreat God to ſet a watch over you by his holy Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Now take up a reſolution to walk with God, in your houſe in a perfect way, that neither your ſelves nor your Relations may be the worſe for your Faſtings, and that Judgment may not come upon you in your houſe, becauſe you have not glorified God in his houſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Uſe your utmoſt intereſt for publick good, for the free paſſage of Juſtice and Judgment, Righteouſneſs and Peace in the Common-wealth and Churches; and though you have no power of your ſelves, wreſtle with God for it that it may be ſo.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Take care that you hold faſt the word of Gods patience in the time of your triall, hold it faſt in Faith and practice, remember that word, <hi>He that continues to the end ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And again, <hi>Let no man take away thy crown.</hi> It is a day of tryal, but look to it, that you may be found upright in the day of tryal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly.</hi> Be open hearted, and open-handed to thoſe that are in miſery and affliction, <hi>Bleſſed are the mercifull, for they ſhall find Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now to him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory in the Church of Chriſt Jeſus, throughout all ages world without end,</hi> Amen.</p>
